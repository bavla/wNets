## US 2016

[data](https://github.com/bavla/cluRC/tree/master/data); [wiki](http://vladowiki.fmf.uni-lj.si/doku.php?id=pro:relc:us)

## WT

Aggregated world trade data from [BACI / CEPII](http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=37). Weight is the trade flow (in thousands current USD). Transformed into Pajek format by Vladimir Batagelj, Fri Aug 11, 2023.

WTyears contains a network for each year; WTtimes contains a single temporal network for all years. The countries are labeled using ISO 2-character codes.
ISO3.nam contains ISO 3-character codes, and countries.nam the long names.

## StarWars 

(undirected with loops)
**nodes:** characters from the Star Wars universe; **links:** coappearance; **weight:** Number of scenes in which the character appears / both characters appear together.<br />
Transformed into Pajek format by Vladimir Batagelj, Sun Feb 9, 2025.

The Kaggle dataset comprises two CSV files:<br />starwars-characters.csv: Contains a list of characters with the following columns:
- number: Unique identifier for each character.
- name: The name of the character.
- scenes: Number of scenes in which the character appears.

starwars-links.csv: Captures the interactions between characters with the following columns:
- character1: Name or ID of the first character.
- character2: Name or ID of the second character.
- scenes: Number of scenes in which both characters appear together.

## StarWarsRT

Star Wars Network / undirected, temporal, multi-relational

weight: Number of scenes in which both characters appear together; time 1-7, time=8 merged<br />
partitions: Number of scenes in which the character appears (i3 - interactions in the episode 3)

## Spotify

Spotify's top 3000 music genres - Network / closest 10 neighbors

From [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/georgeggcoco/closeness-of-music-genres/versions/1) (2023-08-04T13:27:45.393).

This dataset was created based on the work done by [Glenn McDonald](https://furia.com)  over on his website [Every Noise at Once](https://everynoise.com/everynoise1d.cgi). 
George G Coco created and used this dataset for an [interactive network of music genres](https://chartingsounds.streamlit.app).

The dataset includes 3000 music genres in a square grid of dimensions `3000 x 3000` which essentially works as a Heat-Map:
  - Rows and Column names are the names of music genres (by popularity, desc)
  - The values are an abstract 'distance'. A small value means those genres are closely related. A big value means those genres are not related.
  - If you're interested in how exactly this value was calculated, you can read about it in the Provenance section of this dataset.

The network is directed. For most applications convert it to an undirected network first.

The complete network is too large to be stored in GitHub. The corresponding [matrix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bavla/wNets/main/Data/3000_genres.rds) is provided in R data format.
