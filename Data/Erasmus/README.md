# Erasmus

At the bottom of the Erasmus+ page 
[Data visualization on learning mobility projects](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/resources-and-tools/factsheets-statistics-evaluations/statistics/data/learning-mobility-projects), the "Learning mobility flows since 2014" chart can be found.
The interactive chart shows mobility flows between countries since 2014. The colors are related to the sending country. It also provides an option to download the network data.

The network data were transformed into Pajek files
